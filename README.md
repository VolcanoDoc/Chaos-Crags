# Chaos-Crags
This is a MATLAB script written to process data for my PhD project. Data files are prepopulated with information from MCS output files, so if you want to adapt this code to use with another MCS-PhaseEQ model output, you will need to create a new data file, keeping information in that same exact order.
Pretty much this is just a spot to keep my script so people can access it at no cost. Enjoy the petrology.
